# Exploratory Data Analysis on Seeds Dataset

This project was completed for the Introduction to Data Mining course at Fairleigh Dickinson University.

The goal was to explore and assess the quality of the Seeds dataset using R, with a focus on:
- Data resampling with replacement
- Exploratory statistics and five-number summaries
- Data quality checks (missing values, negative values)
- Distribution visualizations (histograms, barplots)
- Standardization and log transformation
- Attribute analysis by class (seed types)
